Tengwarscript Encoder
=====================

A ruby script for encoding ASCII text into LaTeX [tengwarscript](http://djelibeibi.unex.es/tengwar/) according to defined rules.

Tengwar
-------

Tengwar are the letters created by J.R.R. Tolkien for his Middle-Earth universe. The writing system is usable for many different languages provided a so-called "mode" defines which letters and letter combination match to which symbol.

The example mode implemented is based on the german tengwar mode created by [Christian Thalmann](http://www.cinga.ch/langmaking/DTM/dtm.html). There exist many more, most of which can be found at [http://at.mansbjorkman.net/teng_modes.htm](http://at.mansbjorkman.net/teng_modes.htm).


Todo
----

* Create a proper Ruby module (maybe even a gem)
* Add additional tengwar modes (e.g. english, sindarin, quenya)
* Improve script main and/or tests as well as documentation 
* Refactor rules (append, insert, ...)
